LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of LangChain.

LangGraph provides a way to implement stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It is built on top of LangChain, and is designed to be used with it.

Key features of LangGraph include:

1. State Management: LangGraph provides a way to manage state in your LLM applications. This is important for applications that need to maintain context across multiple interactions.

2. Multi-Actor Support: LangGraph allows you to define multiple actors in your application, each with their own state and behavior. This is useful for applications that need to simulate multiple agents or entities.

3. Graph-Based Flow Control: LangGraph uses a graph-based approach to define the flow of your application. This makes it easy to visualize and reason about the behavior of your application.

4. Integration with LangChain: LangGraph is built on top of LangChain, so you can use all of the features of LangChain in your LangGraph applications.

5. Conditional Routing: LangGraph supports conditional routing, allowing you to define different paths through your application based on the state of the application.

6. Cyclic Flows: LangGraph supports cyclic flows, allowing you to define loops and other complex control structures in your application.

7. Streaming Support: LangGraph supports streaming, allowing you to process data in real-time as it becomes available.

LangGraph is particularly useful for building applications like:

- Multi-agent systems where multiple LLM-based agents interact with each other
- Applications that need to maintain state across multiple interactions
- Applications that need to implement complex control flows
- Applications that need to simulate multiple entities or agents

To get started with LangGraph, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install langgraph
```

Then, you can import it in your Python code:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
```

From there, you can define your graph, add nodes, and define the flow of your application.
